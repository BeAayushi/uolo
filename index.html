            Let's venture into the third class of <strong> Personality Development & Grooming Series.</strong> Don't
            divert to any when something is important! Listen to it carefully! Listening is the ability to
            understand the meaning of words and relate to them in some way. To listen is to give attention to sound
            or action. We have included rhymes and songs in this session to help children enhance their listening
            skills. We have also added a game called " Simon Says". Then why waste time. Join us!
